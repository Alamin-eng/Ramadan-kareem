            <p> Ramadan, Arabic Ramaḍān, in Islam, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar and the holy month of fasting. It begins and
            ends with the appearance of the crescent moon. Because the Muslim calendar year is shorter than the Gregorian calendar
            year, Ramadan begins 10–12 days earlier each year, allowing it to fall in every season throughout a 33-year cycle.
            Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of the religion of Islam and one of the highest forms of Islamic worship.
            </p>
         <p class='text-white  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;"> 
            The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance,
        and the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is
        sick or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for you; and that you
        should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps you may be
        thankful.<br>[Quran 2:185]</p>
        <p>Fasting from sunrise (dawn) to sunset is fard (obligatory) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill,
        travelling, elderly, breastfeeding, diabetic, or menstruating.The predawn meal is referred to as suhur, and the
        nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar. Although fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who
        live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca, it is common practice to
        follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day.</p>
        <p class='text-light  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">Narrated Abu Huraira: <br>
        
        Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, "Allah said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons (people) are for them, except fasting which is
        for Me, and I will give the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and from committing sins. If
        one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody should fight or
        quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from
        the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. There are two pleasures for the
        fasting person, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his Lord; then he will
        be pleased because of his fasting." <br>
        
        Reference : Sahih al-Bukhari 1904
        In-book reference : Book 30, Hadith 14</p>
        <p>Ramadan is the month that aims to purify the soul and bring the individual closer to Allah (SWT). Towards the end,
        Muslim mark the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, a 3 day celebration that brings Ramadan to a close.</p>

            <h2 class='text-success'> History</h2>
        </header>
        <p>To understand how Ramadan became such an important part of Islam, we need to go back to the very beginning; 610 A.D. to
        be precise. This is the year during which an Arabian man by the name of Muhammad (PBUH) was meditating in the cave of
        Hira, located in the Jabal an-Nour mountain close to Mecca. Whilst he was meditating, Muhammad (PBUH) was visited by the
        angel Jibril who revealed the first words of what would later be known as the Qur’an. The angel told Muhammad (PBUH)
        that these words came directly from Allah (SWT) and that He is the one and only God. At this time in Arabia, it was
        common for people to worship several different gods, but the angel told Muhammad (PBUH) that Allah is the only,
        all-knowing, true God.</p>

        <p>After revealing the first words of God, the angel commanded that Muhammad (PBUH) recite what he had just been shown.
        Muhammad (PBUH) couldn’t read or write, but he was able to recite the words perfectly. It was explained to Muhammad
        (PBUH) that he was the final of the prophets Allah (SWT) had sent to spread the teachings of the religion of Islam.
        Other prophets Allah (SWT) had sent also feature in the teachings of Judaism and Christianity, and include Nuh (Noah),
        Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus).</p>
        
        <p>The night the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) first saw the angel Jibril is known as Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Power). Many
        Muslims believe this night occurred on the 27th night of the lunar year (which the Islamic calendar is based on), though
        some believe it occurred on any of the other odd nights in the final 10 days of the month.</p>
        
        <p>Muslims hold that all scripture was revealed during Ramadan, the scrolls of Abraham, Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and Quran
        having been handed down on the first, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth (in some sources, eighteenth) and twenty-fourth
        Ramadans,[year needed] respectively.Prophet Muhammed(Saw) is said to have received his first quranic
        revelation on Laylat al-Qadr, one of five odd-numbered nights that fall during the last ten days of Ramadan.

        <p>The common practice is to fast from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhur, while the
        meal at sunset that breaks the fast is called iftar.</p> 
        <p> Whilst Ramadan is a key part of Islam, staying healthy is of utmost importance and for that reason, not everyone will be
        able to abstain from eating and drinking during the day. Those who are pre-pubescent and growing, old and frail, sick
        and on medication, pregnant, breastfeeding, menstruating or travelling are not required to fast (they must pay Fidyah
        instead), but there are other Ramadan requirements they must abide by. <br>
        
        In addition to not eating between sunrise and sunset, Muslims must also refrain from all impure thoughts and activities
        including swearing, gossiping, arguing, fighting and sexual contact. <br>
        
        It is also a requirement that all Muslims with food in excess of their means makes a charitable payment called Fitrana.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The Teachings of Ramadan
            
            As mentioned, Ramadan is observed in order to observe the fourth pillar of Islam known as Sawm. There are several
            reasons why Muslims are required to observe Sawm, including:
            <ul>
                <li>To demonstrate self-control and restraint</li>
                <li>To cleanse their bodies</li>
                <li>To be reminded that some people do not have access to food and go hungry every day</li>
                <li>To be more compassionate and grateful for what they do have</li>
                <li>To strengthen their bond with Allah (SWT)</li>
            </ul>
      
            Time spent not eating during Ramadan should be spent reciting the Qur’an and praying instead. In combination with the
            five teachings of Ramadan listed above, people will be able to become better Muslims and better members of their wider
            community.

        <p> There are volumes upon volumes worth of information available on Ramadan. For the same of simplicity, in today’s post,
        we will highlight what the Holy Quran says about this blessed month. 
        </p> <br> 
        <p class='text-white  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
        "O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become
        righteous" -- Surat Al-Baqarah 2:183</p>

        With the above verse, the Holy Quran makes it clear that fasting was ordained compulsory on all Muslims and that they
        have to fast if they are to stay righteous.
        <br> <br>
        
        <p class='text-white  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
        "...But to fast is best for you, if you only knew." -- Surat Al-Baqarah 2:184</p>
        In those days some might question the benefits of fasting apart from blessings. Science and medicine today have all but
        confirmed that there are numerous health benefits to fasting for a month in a year. It is a great way to cleanse the
        stomach and also has many health benefits for the brain. <br> <br>
        
        
        <p class='text-white  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
        "The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of
        guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a
        journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and
        [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will
        be grateful." -- Surat Al-Baqarah 2:185 </p>
        
        One of the stand out features of the month of Ramadan is that the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Mohammed (PBUH)
        during this time. This book of guidance is an invaluable treasure trove of information on how to live life as a good
        Muslim to this day.<br> <br>

        <p class='text-white  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
            "Allah is with those who restrain themselves." -- Quran 16: 128</p>
        
        Fasting teaches restraint; the ability to control worldly desires and spend time in prayer and meditation. Fasting is a
        noble act that is much beloved by Allah (SWT). <br><br>

        Narrated Abu Huraira:
        
        Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Fasting is a shield (or a screen or a shelter). So, the person observing fasting should
        avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody fights with him or
        abuses him, he should tell him twice, 'I am fasting." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the
        smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. (Allah says
        about the fasting person), 'He has left his food, drink and desires for My sake. The fast is for Me. So I will reward
        (the fasting person) for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times."

        </header>
        <p> Lailat-ul-Qadr is the prized jewel of Ramadan. The Night of Power (Laylatul Qadr) is the most precious night of the whole year, filled with abundant mercy and
        blessings. In the words of the Holy Qur’an, it is “better than a thousand months.” <br>
        
        Every Muslim is encouraged to seek Laylatul Qadr and increase in prayers and worship. Splitting your Zakat and Sadaqah
        among the last ten nights of Ramadan means that you can be sure to catch the Night of Power!</p>
        <p class='text-white  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6' style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">"Allah has made Laylat al-Qadr in this month, which is better than a thousand months, as Allaah says...The Night of
        Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months. Therein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] by Allaah's
        Permission with all Decrees, there is peace until the appearance of dawn." -- Al-Qadar 97:1-5</p> <br> <br>
        <p>After 30 days of fasting, the end of the month of Ramadan is observed with a day of celebration, called Eid-ul-Fitr. On
        this day, Muslims gather in one place to offer a prayer of thanks. It is traditional to wear new clothes, visit friends
        and relatives, exchange gifts, eat delicious dishes prepared for this occasion, and wait patiently for the next year.</p>
        <p> Ramadan is a gift from Allah (SWT); an opportunity for Muslims to capitalize on and earn His blessings and a way to seek
        salvation and forgiveness. We should all make the most of it. Let’s all make this Ramadan the best Ramadan yet.</p>
