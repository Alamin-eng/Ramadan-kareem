            </header>
            <p class='rounded p-2'> Ramadan, Arabic Ramaḍān, in Islam, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar and the
                holy month of fasting. It begins and
                ends with the appearance of the crescent moon. Because the Muslim calendar year is shorter than the
                Gregorian calendar
                year, Ramadan begins 10–12 days earlier each year, allowing it to fall in every season throughout a
                33-year cycle.
                Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of the religion of Islam and one of the highest forms of Islamic
                worship.
            </p>
            <p class='text-white bg-info rounded border p-2 text-center h6'
                style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
                The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Quran; a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs
                of the guidance,
                and the criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and
                whosoever of you is
                sick or on a journey, a number of other days. Allah desires for you ease; He desires not hardship for
                you; and that you
                should complete the period, and that you should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that perhaps
                you may be
                thankful.<br>[Quran 2:185]</p>
            <p class='rounded p-2'>Fasting from sunrise (dawn) to sunset is fard (obligatory) for all adult Muslims who
                are not acutely or chronically ill,
                travelling, elderly, breastfeeding, diabetic, or menstruating.The predawn meal is referred to as suhur,
                and the
                nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar. Although fatwas have been issued declaring that
                Muslims who
                live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca, it is common
                practice to
                follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day.</p>
            <p class='text-warning bg-success rounded  border shadaow p-1 text-center h6'
                style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">Narrated Abu Huraira: <br>

                Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, "Allah said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons (people) are for them, except
                fasting which is
                for Me, and I will give the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and from
                committing sins. If
                one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody
                should fight or
                quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell
                coming out from
                the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. There are two
                pleasures for the
                fasting person, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his
                Lord; then he will
                be pleased because of his fasting." <br>

                In-book reference : Book 30, Hadith 14</p>
            <p class='rounded p-2'>Ramadan is the month that aims to purify the soul and bring the individual closer to
                Allah (SWT). Towards the end,
                Muslim mark the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, a 3 day celebration that brings Ramadan to a close.</p>

                <h2 class='text-success'> History</h2>
            </header>
            <p class='rounded p-2'>To understand how Ramadan became such an important part of Islam, we need to go back
                to the very beginning; 610 A.D. to
                be precise. This is the year during which an Arabian man by the name of Muhammad (PBUH) was meditating
                in the cave of
                Hira, located in the Jabal an-Nour mountain close to Mecca. Whilst he was meditating, Muhammad (PBUH)
                was visited by the
                angel Jibril who revealed the first words of what would later be known as the Qur’an. The angel told
                Muhammad (PBUH)
                that these words came directly from Allah (SWT) and that He is the one and only God. At this time in
                Arabia, it was
                common for people to worship several different gods, but the angel told Muhammad (PBUH) that Allah is
                the only,
                all-knowing, true God.</p>

            <p class='rounded p-2'>After revealing the first words of God, the angel commanded that Muhammad (PBUH)
                recite what he had just been shown.
                Muhammad (PBUH) couldn’t read or write, but he was able to recite the words perfectly. It was explained
                to Muhammad
                (PBUH) that he was the final of the prophets Allah (SWT) had sent to spread the teachings of the
                religion of Islam.
                Other prophets Allah (SWT) had sent also feature in the teachings of Judaism and Christianity, and
                include Nuh (Noah),
                Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus).</p>

            <p class='rounded p-2'>The night the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) first saw the angel Jibril is known as Laylat
                al-Qadr (the Night of Power). Many
                Muslims believe this night occurred on the 27th night of the lunar year (which the Islamic calendar is
                based on), though
                some believe it occurred on any of the other odd nights in the final 10 days of the month.</p>

            <p class='rounded p-2'>Muslims hold that all scripture was revealed during Ramadan, the scrolls of Abraham,
                Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and Quran
                having been handed down on the first, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth (in some sources, eighteenth) and
                twenty-fourth
                Ramadans,[year needed] respectively.Prophet Muhammed(Saw) is said to have received his first quranic
                revelation on Laylat al-Qadr, one of five odd-numbered nights that fall during the last ten days of
                Ramadan.

            </header>
            <p class='rounded p-2'>The common practice is to fast from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast
                is called the suhur, while the
                meal at sunset that breaks the fast is called iftar.</p>
            <p class='rounded p-2'> Whilst Ramadan is a key part of Islam, staying healthy is of utmost importance and
                for that reason, not everyone will be
                able to abstain from eating and drinking during the day. Those who are pre-pubescent and growing, old
                and frail, sick
                and on medication, pregnant, breastfeeding, menstruating or travelling are not required to fast (they
                must pay Fidyah
                instead), but there are other Ramadan requirements they must abide by. <br>

                In addition to not eating between sunrise and sunset, Muslims must also refrain from all impure thoughts
                and activities
                including swearing, gossiping, arguing, fighting and sexual contact. <br>

                It is also a requirement that all Muslims with food in excess of their means makes a charitable payment
                called Fitrana.
            </p>
            <p class='rounded p-2'>
                The Teachings of Ramadan

                As mentioned, Ramadan is observed in order to observe the fourth pillar of Islam known as Sawm. There
                are several
                reasons why Muslims are required to observe Sawm, including:
            <ul class='text-white rounded'>
                <li>To demonstrate self-control and restraint</li>
                <li>To cleanse their bodies</li>
                <li>To be reminded that some people do not have access to food and go hungry every day</li>
                <li>To be more compassionate and grateful for what they do have</li>
                <li>To strengthen their bond with Allah (SWT)</li>
            </ul>

            Time spent not eating during Ramadan should be spent reciting the Qur’an and praying instead. In combination
            with the
            five teachings of Ramadan listed above, people will be able to become better Muslims and better members of
            their wider
            community.

            </header>
            <p class='rounded p-2'> There are volumes upon volumes worth of information available on Ramadan. For the
                sake of simplicity, in today’s post,
                we will highlight what the Holy Quran says about this blessed month.

                "O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you
                may become
                righteous" -- Surat Al-Baqarah 2:183</p>

            With the above verse, the Holy Quran makes it clear that fasting was ordained compulsory on all Muslims and
            that they
            have to fast if they are to stay righteous.
            <br> <br>

            <p class='text-white bg-info rounded border shadow p-2 text-center h6'
                style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
                "...But to fast is best for you, if you only knew." -- Surat Al-Baqarah 2:184</p>
            In those days some might question the benefits of fasting apart from blessings. Science and medicine today
            have all but
            confirmed that there are numerous health benefits to fasting for a month in a year. It is a great way to
            cleanse the
            stomach and also has many health benefits for the brain. <br> <br>


            <p class='text-white  bg-info rounded border shadow p-2 text-center h6'
                style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">
                "The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear
                proofs of
                guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is
                ill or on a
                journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you
                hardship and
                [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and
                perhaps you will
                be grateful." -- Surat Al-Baqarah 2:185 </p>

            One of the stand out features of the month of Ramadan is that the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet
            Mohammed (PBUH)
            during this time. This book of guidance is an invaluable treasure trove of information on how to live life
            as a good
            Muslim to this day.<br> <br>

                "Allah is with those who restrain themselves." -- Quran 16: 128</p>

            Fasting teaches restraint; the ability to control worldly desires and spend time in prayer and meditation.
            Fasting is a
            noble act that is much beloved by Allah (SWT). <br><br>

                Narrated Abu Huraira:

                Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Fasting is a shield (or a screen or a shelter). So, the person observing
                fasting should
                avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody
                fights with him or
                abuses him, he should tell him twice, 'I am fasting." The Prophet (ﷺ) added, "By Him in Whose Hands my
                soul is, the
                smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of
                musk. (Allah says
                about the fasting person), 'He has left his food, drink and desires for My sake. The fast is for Me. So
                I will reward
                (the fasting person) for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times."

                Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "There is a gate in Paradise called Ar-Raiyan, and those who observe fasts
                will enter through it
                on the Day of Resurrection and none except them will enter through it. It will be said, 'Where are those
                who used to
                observe fasts?' They will get up, and none except them will enter through it. After their entry the gate
                will be closed
                and nobody will enter through it."<br>

                The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever established prayers on the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping
                for a reward
                from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven; and whoever fasts in the month of Ramadan out
                of sincere faith,
                and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven." <br>

            </header>
            <p class='rounded p-2'> Lailat-ul-Qadr is the prized jewel of Ramadan. The Night of Power (Laylatul Qadr) is
                the most precious night of the whole year, filled with abundant mercy and
                blessings. In the words of the Holy Qur’an, it is “better than a thousand months.” <br>

                Every Muslim is encouraged to seek Laylatul Qadr and increase in prayers and worship. Splitting your
                Zakat and Sadaqah
                among the last ten nights of Ramadan means that you can be sure to catch the Night of Power!</p>
            <p class='text-white bg-info rounded border shadow p-2 text-center h6'
                style="width:77vw;font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;">"Allah has made Laylat al-Qadr in this month,
                which is better than a thousand months, as Allaah says...The Night of
                Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months. Therein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] by
                Allaah's
                Permission with all Decrees, there is peace until the appearance of dawn." -- Al-Qadar 97:1-5</p> <br>
            <p class='rounded p-2'>After 30 days of fasting, the end of the month of Ramadan is observed with a day of
                celebration, called Eid-ul-Fitr. On
                this day, Muslims gather in one place to offer a prayer of thanks. It is traditional to wear new
                clothes, visit friends
                and relatives, exchange gifts, eat delicious dishes prepared for this occasion, and wait patiently for
                the next year.</p>
            <p class='rounded p-2'> Ramadan is a gift from Allah (SWT); an opportunity for Muslims to capitalize on and
                earn His blessings and a way to seek
                salvation and forgiveness. We should all make the most of it. Let’s all make this Ramadan the best
                Ramadan yet.</p>
